This is a simple food ordering interface built on react 
It contains 3 pages 
    1 Home page  
    2 Menu page  
    3 My order page   

Using it is simple click on menu or the bottom menu button ,
The menu page will pop up then fill the input field and click on add button on the right of input field to add items
after adding click on checkout it will lead you to your bill page.  

notes to remember This is only the front end and nothis is permanent.
for eg. if you get to your bill page and if you refresh it all the items that are being displayed in your bill will be removed.
similkarly if you refresh your menu page after adding items then your added items will be removed too.


And yeah it is not mobile friendly the CSS code that makes the UI is PC based.
